# darkCON 

Here's some of my stuff from [darkCON CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/1250) which was in February 2021. Unfortunately the challenges are no longer available and the source code for some of them hasn't been released. 

I ended up placing 139 (under the name human_consumption) out of 663. Not too bad in my opinion :)
