# CTF Challenges

A simple repo containing some of the CTF challenges I've done over the years. They are somewhat disparate and lacking in written analysis since I do them as my schedule permits, but I hope to remedy that soon, and I'll still put them here for documentation purposes. 

Some featured challenges with writeups (of varying quality):
- [TryHackMe Reversing ELF](./reversing-elf/)
- [OverTheWire Natas](./overthewire/natas/)
- [DarkCON easyPHP](./darkCON/easyPHP/)

Take a look at some of the other CTF stuff I have if you want. I plan on adding writeups for what I have, and adding aadditional CTFs and writeups.

DarkCON:
- [meme_stash](./darkCON/meme_stash/)
- [ezpz](./darkCON/ezpz/)
- [WTFPHP](./darkCON/WTFPHP/)

[Protostar](./protostar/)

[Microcorruption](./microcorruption/)

[pwn.college](./pwncollege/)

[pwnable](./pwnable/)
